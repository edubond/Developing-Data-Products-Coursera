#"Only" 1 thing to see in Milano

Date : 15 September 2018

Milano is a city full of art and history, there're tons of things to see. In this project i have choosen "only" one of them. 

*NOTE: The links of "monumentsite" directs you to the wikipedia pages of the monuments. Note that are in **italian** language.*

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
df <- data.frame(latitude = c(45.464104), 
                 longitude = c(9.191909),
                 name = c("Duomo di Milano")
                 )

#monumenticon <- makeIcon(iconUrl = "https://github.com/edubond/Developing-Data-Products-Coursera/blob/master/School-01-128.png", iconWidth = 31*215/230, iconHeight = 31, iconAnchorX = 31*215/230/2, iconAnchorY = 16)

monumentsite <- c(
  "<a href='https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duomo_di_Milano'>Duomo di Milano</a>"
)

df %>% leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addMarkers(
    #icon = monumenticon
    popup = monumentsite)


```
