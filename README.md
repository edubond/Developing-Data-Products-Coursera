# Developing-Data-Products-Coursera
This is the week 2 assignment project. There are a png image file, that is not used in the project cause the line in the code that use that are commented. Then there are several project files in rmd and in html. Since the html files are too big are shown only the raw data, so to see the *HTML Project* you should rerun the rmd files with knit i think. Sorry for that. 
The files contain each a different number of things to see.
