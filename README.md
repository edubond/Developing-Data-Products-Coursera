# Developing-Data-Products-Coursera
This is the week 2 assignment project. There are a png image file, that is not used in the project cause the line in the code that use that are commented. Then there are two project files, one in rmd and one in html. Since the html file is too big are shown only the raw data, so to see the *HTML Project* you have to download it.
